Initial Development Plan

 1. Parallel Implementation- 
Use OpenMP for parallelizing independent vertex-level computations within each machine.

- Use MPI to distribute the workload (e.g., ranges of trees or subsets of nodes) across multiple machines.

- Combine both for a hybrid model where MPI handles inter-node and OpenMP handles intra-node
parallelism.

 2. Performance & Scalability Testing
- Test on Bubble-Sort Networks of increasing size.

- Measure execution time, speedup, and scalability.

- Perform both strong and weak scaling experiments.

 3. Documentation & Reporting- 
Document the approach, parallelization strategy, and performance results.

- Maintain code, results, and progress updates on GitHub.

- Include meaningful commit messages and a brief project summary.

 4. Demo Preparation- 
Prepare scripts or commands to demonstrate your implementation.

- Clearly show the impact of parallelization using performance results.
